// overlap close are read without the lock, and fetch is called for every span
// that plan needs. Only then does Sync open one transaction whose first
// statement takes pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('ohlc:' || symbol)), re-read
// the stored range and overlap close, and make the append-or-replace decision
// again under that lock, so two syncs of one symbol still store one after the
// other and can't leave days on two scales. When the locked decision asks for
// the spans already fetched, their bars are stored and no provider call runs
// under the lock. Only when another sync changed the stored history in
// between, so the decision now needs a different span, is fetch called again,
// while the lock is held. A slow provider therefore holds neither the lock
// nor a pooled connection in the normal case.
//
// Nothing stored yet: start through end is fetched and inserted.
//
// Stored history that starts on or before start: one fetch through end. With
// no weekday missing from start up to the last stored day it begins on the
// last stored day. With one missing it begins on the closest stored day
// before the first missing weekday (or on that weekday when no earlier day
// is stored from the scan start on). Only days from start, and no more than
// gapScanDays before the last stored day, are looked at, so an older gap
// stays as it is and backtest create fails on it (the missing-session check
// from lhjnilsson/foreverbull-internal#123). Every check day, the last stored day and the stored day
// next to the gap, is inside the fetched span. When each comes back with a
// close within rescaleTolerance of the stored one, the bars for missing days
// are inserted, the last stored day is upserted as before, and every other
// stored row is left as it is.
// Otherwise (a close moved, a check day is missing from the fetch, or either
// close is not a positive finite price) the scale of the stored history can't
// be trusted, so the whole range from the first stored day is fetched again
// and replaced.
//
// Stored history that starts after start: start through the last stored day
// (or end, when later) is fetched and replaced, so no stored day is left on an
// old scale.
//
// fetch errors come back unchanged. A refused bar is an InvalidPriceError and
// a refetch with no bars is a NoBarsError; in both cases the stored rows stay
// as they were. Any database error is a StoreError.
