# ETF universes — implementation contract

This document is the implementation contract for point-in-time ETF universes in `pkg/backtest`. It is not code. Read it before changing the iShares scraper, `backtest_period_asset`, finance `asset` / `ohlc`, or Zipline ingest.

Goal: ETF-built universes that are stable and point-in-time. Identity is ISIN. Ticker is a dated alias. Membership is intervals from consecutive as-of diffs. Ingest unions every instrument that ever appears; the session filters to members on date `t`.

## 1. Problem

`CreateBacktestFromETF` (`pkg/backtest/internal/stream/command/backtest.go`) builds a backtest from an iShares product. Three defects make that universe neither stable nor point-in-time.

### 1.1 Yearly first-hit

`ISharesETFLoopup.GetAssets` (`pkg/backtest/internal/stream/dependency/backtest.go`) takes a list of calendar years. For each year it runs:

```text
for _, year := range years {
    for day := 0; day <= 365; day++ {
        date = {year}-01-01 + day
        GET ajax?tab=all&fileType=json&asOfDate=YYYYMMDD
        if aaData is empty: continue
        retMap[year] = parsed rows
        break
    }
}
```

The first non-empty iShares `aaData` in that year becomes *the* holdings list for the whole year. January reconstitutions, month-end membership, and anything after the first hit are discarded. `CreateBacktestFromETF` then stores one `backtest_period` per calendar year (`start_date` = Jan 1, `end_date` = Dec 31) and copies that single list into `backtest_period_asset`.

### 1.2 Ticker as primary key

Finance identity is the ticker:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS asset (
    symbol text primary key,
    name text);
```

`ohlc` is keyed the same way: `UNIQUE (symbol, time)` with `symbol TEXT references asset(symbol)`. Proto `foreverbull.finance.v1.Asset` already has `string ISIN = 3`, and the iShares row already supplies it (`dependency.Asset.ISIN` from `row[8]`). Neither is stored. FB then META are two assets. A ticker recycle is a silent identity collision.

`GetAssetRequest` already has `oneof identifier { string symbol = 1; string isin = 2; }`. `CreateBacktestFromETF` always sends `GetAssetRequest_Symbol`.

### 1.3 `enabled` means GetAsset succeeded

For each scraped Equity row, `CreateBacktestFromETF` calls `Marketdata.GetAsset` by symbol (Yahoo metadata for every backtest provider; `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER` is not read). `backtest_period_asset.enabled` is true when that call succeeds and false when it fails. `DownloadFinancialData` fails create (and removes the backtest) if `DownloadHistoricalData` returns `STATUS_ERROR` for any symbol; it does not disable the member and continue.

`enabled` is therefore “the vendor knows this ticker,” not “this ISIN is in the ETF on these dates.” Non-Equity rows (`AssetType != "Equity"`) are skipped; that filter stays.

### 1.4 Ingest union, session empty list

Ingest is already a union, which is correct:

- `DownloadFinancialData` walks every period, keeps enabled symbols plus `backtest.benchmark`, and downloads `[periods[0].start_date, periods[-1].end_date]`.
- `SQLIngester.what_to_ingest` (`client/zipline/src/foreverbull_zipline/data_bundles/foreverbull.py`) does the same set: enabled `period.assets` plus `benchmark`, then `SELECT open, high, low, close, volume, time FROM ohlc WHERE symbol='…' AND time BETWEEN …`.

The session does not filter that union. `ZipelineSession.RunBacktest` (`pkg/backtest/internal/backtest/engine_session.go`) calls:

```go
workers.Process(ctx, period.Portfolio.Timestamp.AsTime(), []string{}, period.Portfolio)
```

`worker.Pool.Process(ctx, timestamp, symbols, portfolio)` forwards `symbols` to the algorithm. `Process([]string{})` means the worker never receives the members as of `t`. Parallel functions iterate the slice and do no work; sequential functions receive an empty list.

Zipline equity metadata computes `auto_close_date = end_date + 1 day` and then overwrites it with `None` (`TODO: How to autoclose date?`). Dropped names never close.

## 2. Design principles

1. **ISIN is identity.** One iShares ISIN is one instrument for the life of the backtest. FB and META are one asset with two ticker intervals.
2. **Ticker is a dated alias.** `ohlc` stays on `symbol`. Do not rewrite bars onto ISIN. Map ISIN → symbol through `asset_symbol`.
3. **Membership is intervals, not calendar years.** Consecutive as-of snapshots are diffed by ISIN. Adds and drops open or close `universe_member` rows. Ticker changes do not.
4. **Ingest unions; the session is point-in-time.** Every symbol that ever appears (plus benchmark) is downloaded and ingested. On date `t` the session passes only current members into `Process`.
5. **Sample, do not dump daily.** Month-end or known rebalance as-of dates. Cache those snapshots. Do not walk `day := 0; day <= 365` to find the first hit.
6. **Reuse existing column types.** `text`, `date`, `boolean`, `timestamp` as they already appear on `backtest`, `backtest_period`, `asset`, and `ohlc`. No native `uuid` columns.

## 3. What already exists (reuse)

| Capability | Where | Universe should |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iShares holdings + ISIN | `ISharesETFLoopup.GetSnapshot` / `ListSnapshotDates`; `dependency.Asset.{Symbol,Name,Sector,AssetType,ISIN}` | Keep the product URL and JSON parse. Sample month-end `asOfDate`s (not `day := 0; day <= 365`). `GetSnapshot` is Equity-only and includes ISIN. `CreateBacktestFromETF` uses those APIs. `GetAssets(years)` is a year-keyed compatibility wrapper |
| ETF → benchmark ticker | `GetBenchmark` (`iShares S&P 100` → `OEF`) | Unchanged; `backtest.benchmark text NOT NULL` |
| Yearly period + membership | `backtest_period` / `backtest_period_asset` | Stop using calendar-year lists as membership. Keep `backtest(name, benchmark)` |
| Vendor asset lookup | `Marketdata.GetAsset(symbol)`; RPC oneof already has `isin` | Do not switch Yahoo/Alpaca. Do not add a provider. ISIN comes from iShares, not from `GetAsset` |
| Bars | `ohlc(symbol, time)` | Ingest still writes `(symbol, time)`. Session maps ISIN → symbol then reads bars by symbol |
| Trading calendar | `trading_calendar_date (code, date)` PK | Month-end as-of dates = last `date` per month in range for `XNYS` |
| Zipline ingest | `SQLIngester` union of enabled symbols + benchmark | Union becomes “every alias that ever appears + benchmark.” Set `auto_close_date`; do not null it |
| Session worker | `Process(timestamp, symbols, portfolio)` | Pass PIT tickers, not `[]string{}` |

`backtest_period_asset.enabled` and yearly `backtest_period` rows remain until callers migrate. New membership lives in `universe_member`. Do not dual-write forever; the yearly table is the old model.

## 4. Identity and aliases

### 4.1 ISIN

Source of truth for a holdings row is iShares `row[8]` (`dependency.Asset.ISIN`). Proto field is `foreverbull.finance.v1.Asset.ISIN` (`string`). Store it as `text`, same as `asset.symbol` and `backtest.name`.

`asset.symbol` stays the finance primary key. Ingest (`repository.Asset.Store(symbol, name)`, `ohlc.Store(symbol, …)`, `DownloadHistoricalDataRequest.symbols`) does not change. Yahoo `GetAsset(symbol)` and Alpaca `GetAsset(symbol)` stay symbol-keyed.

### 4.2 `instrument`

Stable identity. One iShares ISIN is one instrument. `id` equals `isin` (text, not uuid). `name` is the issuer string from iShares; it is not identity.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS instrument (
    id text PRIMARY KEY,
    isin text UNIQUE,
    name text
);
```

FB then META is one `instrument` row. A new ticker is a new `asset_symbol` interval, not a new instrument.

### 4.3 `asset_symbol`

Ticker history for one ISIN. Half-open `[from_date, to_date)`. `to_date` NULL means current.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS asset_symbol (
    isin text NOT NULL,
    symbol text NOT NULL,
    from_date date NOT NULL,
    to_date date,
    PRIMARY KEY (isin, from_date)
);
```

`isin` matches `instrument.isin`. `symbol` is the same `text` as `asset.symbol` / `ohlc.symbol`. `from_date` / `to_date` are `date`, same as `backtest_period.start_date`. Do not FK `symbol` to `asset(symbol)` at write time: the alias can exist before `Store` creates the asset row.

Example: FB then META is one ISIN, two rows. Membership does not close.

`asset_symbol` is shared by every ETF backtest. `CreateBacktestFromETF` writes each alias of its own window with `Instrument.StoreAlias`, which reads the ISIN's rows and changes them in one transaction:

- A NULL `to_date` only says the ticker was still current in the last list that backtest read. A backtest that ends before a rename leaves FB open-ended.
- An open-ended row yields to a different ticker that starts after its `from_date`. When a later backtest stores META from 2021-10-31, the open FB row is closed at 2021-10-31. When the later window starts after the rename and only sees META from its start, FB is closed at that start; nothing is known about the days in between.
- The same rule works in reverse order. A new open-ended row is capped at the `from_date` of the next stored row of a different ticker. An older backtest that sees FB open-ended after META is stored from 2021-10-31 stores FB up to 2021-10-31, not NULL.
- Rows of the same ticker that overlap are one alias and are stored as their union. A known `to_date` wins over an open one.
- Any other overlap of two tickers is refused with `asset_symbol_no_overlap` (`repository.ErrAliasConflict`), and the create fails. That covers a row with a known `to_date` that another ticker starts inside, an open row that another ticker starts on or before, and two tickers with the same `from_date`. A stored row is never renamed in place.

Known limit: creates run one at a time, because the broker handles each command from one JetStream subscription. `StoreAlias` locks the ISIN's existing rows (`FOR UPDATE`) but takes no advisory lock. If creates ever run in parallel, two of them can miss each other's new rows for one ISIN; the exclusion constraint then fails one create instead of merging its rows. Take `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on the ISIN before that changes.

On date `t`, current ticker is:

```sql
SELECT symbol FROM asset_symbol
 WHERE isin = $1
   AND from_date <= $2
   AND (to_date IS NULL OR $2 < to_date);
```

Mapping helpers (`pkg/finance/internal/repository.Instruments`):

- `Resolve(symbol, t)` → the `instrument` whose alias at `t` is that ticker
- `Symbols(instrument, t)` → the ticker of that ISIN at `t`

Ingest unions `DISTINCT symbol` for every ISIN that appears in `universe_member` for that backtest, including expired aliases, plus `backtest.benchmark`.

### 4.4 Missing ISIN

A holdings row with empty `ISIN` is skipped. It does not create an `instrument` and does not get a synthetic id. Do not match or merge rows by ticker or issuer name. FB and META are one instrument only when iShares supplies the same ISIN.

## 5. Snapshots

### 5.1 Cache

Do not refetch iShares on every `CreateBacktestFromETF`. Two layers:

**Raw JSON (scraper, this step).** `ISharesETFLoopup` caches each successful iShares `aaData` response on the filesystem, keyed by ETF slug and `asOfDate`:

```text
{cacheDir}/{etf_slug}/{YYYYMMDD}.json
# example: iShares_S_P_100/20221231.json
```

- Runtime dir: `$FOREVERBULL_ETF_SNAPSHOT_CACHE`, else `{os.UserCacheDir()}/foreverbull/etf_snapshots` (temp dir if the user cache is unavailable).
- Tests: `pkg/backtest/internal/stream/dependency/testdata/etf_snapshots` fixtures, or a temp dir. Unit tests use `httptest`; they must not hit live iShares.
- Empty `aaData` is unpublished: do not cache it. `GetSnapshot` then walks back at most 6 calendar days and caches the first published body under the requested as-of.
- Request shape stays `tab=all`, `fileType=json`, `asOfDate=YYYYMMDD`.
- API: `GetSnapshot(etf, asOf) ([]Asset, error)` (Equity-only, includes ISIN) and `ListSnapshotDates(etf, start, end) ([]time.Time, error)` (last calendar day of each month in range, plus any dates already in the cache).

**Parsed holdings table (later).** Persist membership rows once `CreateBacktestFromETF` is rewired:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS etf_holdings_snapshot (
    etf_name text NOT NULL,
    as_of_date date NOT NULL,
    isin text NOT NULL,
    symbol text NOT NULL,
    name text,
    sector text,
    asset_type text NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (etf_name, as_of_date, isin)
);
```

Column types match `dependency.Asset` and `backtest.name` (`text` / `date`). `etf_name` is the product key already used by `GetAssets` (e.g. `iShares S&P 100`). When the table exists, empty `aaData` should try the previous session on `trading_calendar_date` instead of a 6-day lookback.

### 5.2 Sampling

Replace the yearly first-hit loop. The scraper now samples; it does not walk every calendar day.

For `[start_date, end_date]`:

1. `ListSnapshotDates` takes the last calendar day of each month in range. Cached reconstitution dates in that range are included.
2. `GetSnapshot` GETs each as-of once (filesystem cache on repeat).
3. Later: load `trading_calendar_date` for `XNYS` (`code text`, `date date`) and use the last session of each month; insert parsed rows into `etf_holdings_snapshot`.

Do not sample every calendar day. Do not keep “first published day of the year” as a special case. A year of snapshots is 12 month-ends (plus lookback only when a month-end is unpublished), never `day := 0; day <= 365`.

Tests of the scraper use `httptest` or cached fixtures. Do not hit live iShares in unit tests.

## 6. Diff → membership intervals

### 6.1 `universe_member`

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS universe_member (
    backtest_name text REFERENCES backtest (name) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    isin text NOT NULL,
    from_date date NOT NULL,
    to_date date,
    PRIMARY KEY (backtest_name, isin, from_date)
);
```

Half-open `[from_date, to_date)`. `to_date` NULL means still a member at the backtest end. `backtest_name` matches `backtest.name` / `backtest_period.backtest_name`.

Members on date `t`:

```sql
SELECT isin FROM universe_member
 WHERE backtest_name = $1
   AND from_date <= $2
   AND (to_date IS NULL OR $2 < to_date);
```

Join `asset_symbol` at `t` to get the ticker list for `Process`.

### 6.2 Consecutive snapshot diff

Order snapshots for the ETF by `as_of_date`. Restrict to `asset_type = 'Equity'` (same filter as `CreateBacktestFromETF`). Diff **by ISIN**, not by ticker.

| Si vs Si+1 | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ISIN in Si+1, not in Si | **Add.** Insert `universe_member (from_date = Si+1.as_of_date, to_date NULL)`. Upsert `asset_symbol` for the new ticker. |
| ISIN in Si, not in Si+1 | **Drop.** Close `universe_member.to_date = Si+1.as_of_date`. Do not delete the row. |
| Same ISIN, different symbol | **Rename.** Close the old `asset_symbol.to_date = Si+1.as_of_date`; insert a new alias from Si+1. Leave `universe_member` open. |
| Same ISIN, same symbol | No-op. |

Seed at the backtest start from the last list published on or before `start_date`. S0 is that list: for a 2020-01-01 start it is the 2019-12-31 month-end, and for a start that is itself a published as-of it is that day. Every Equity ISIN in S0 opens a member interval at `start_date` and an `asset_symbol` interval for that ticker from the same day, and S0's list holds until the next as-of after the start. A list published after the start is a look-ahead: an ISIN that first appears in the 2020-01-31 list (or in a cached mid-January as-of) is not a member before that as-of, and is a member from it.

`CreateBacktestFromETF` reads S0 with the same `GetSnapshot` call as the window. iShares serves a holdings file for any past `asOfDate`, so it lists the month-ends (and cached as-of dates) in the three months before the start and reads them newest first, stopping at the first published file. A month-end with no file is skipped, not a stop. A gap in the window is filled from S0, not from a later list. S0 is moved to `start_date`; as-of dates before the start are not stored.

Only when nothing is published on or before the start within that walk (an ETF that launched after it, or a run of missing files) does the first list after the start seed it, so the universe is not empty. That fallback is a look-ahead and is logged as a warning with `etf`, `start_date`, and `snapshot_date` (the as-of used): `no holdings snapshot published on or before the backtest start, seeded from the first one after it`.

The seed copy keeps each ISIN and ticker, so the next as-of is not an add or a rename unless its list differs.

Adds/drops change membership. Ticker changes do not.

`pkg/backtest/internal/universe.Diff` is the consecutive-snapshot differ. It emits half-open `universe_member` intervals (and ticker alias intervals) and opens the first ones at the first snapshot's as-of; it does not know the backtest window. Persistence is `universe_member` in the backtest repository. `CreateBacktestFromETF` loads month-end snapshots, moves S0 to the backtest start, diffs them, and writes `instrument` / `asset_symbol` / `universe_member`.

### 6.3 Hysteresis (optional)

To ignore a one-off as-of glitch, require two consecutive snapshots before committing an add or a drop:

- Add: ISIN present in Si and Si+1, absent before Si → `from_date = Si.as_of_date`.
- Drop: ISIN absent in Si and Si+1, present before Si → `to_date = Si.as_of_date`.

Renames still apply on the first snapshot that shows the new ticker (the ISIN never left). Default the flag off until a product proves noisy; the schema does not change.

This step leaves hysteresis off. Month-end (and cached reconstitution) as-of dates are already sampled, so a two-snapshot confirmation would lag a genuine add/drop by a month. Enable per product if a feed is noisy.

## 7. Ingest union vs session PIT

```text
snapshots ──diff──► universe_member (ISIN intervals)
                 └─► asset_symbol (ticker intervals)

ingest:   DISTINCT symbol in asset_symbol for those ISINs  ∪  benchmark
session:  members at t  →  tickers at t  →  Process(ctx, t, tickers, portfolio)
```

### 7.1 Ingest

`DownloadFinancialData` and `SQLIngester.what_to_ingest` take the union of every alias, not the members of the last calendar year. Date window is the backtest start/end (today: `periods[0].start_date` … `periods[-1].end_date`). Benchmark is always included.

If a symbol fails `DownloadHistoricalData`, record a download error. Do **not** delete `universe_member`. Vendor coverage is not membership. `GetAsset` success is not membership.

Keep writing `asset(symbol, name)` and `ohlc(symbol, time)`. Mapping layer only.

### 7.2 Session

`ZipelineSession.RunBacktest` must stop calling `Process([]string{})`. On each period timestamp `t`:

1. ISINs from `universe_member` at `t`.
2. Symbols from `asset_symbol` at `t`.
3. `workers.Process(ctx, t, symbols, portfolio)`.

Empty universe → empty slice (algorithm sees no names). That is different from today’s bug, where the slice is always empty.

A member whose prices have ended is left out of `Process`. A delisting mid-month keeps the ISIN in `universe_member` until the next month-end list drops it, but the bundle has no bar for it after the delisting. Before the first bar the session reads, for each member's tickers, the ISIN's last `ohlc` bar under any of its tickers for the backtest's provider, before the day after the backtest's last period (a later download for another backtest is not in this bundle). On date `t` a ticker whose ISIN's last bar is before the UTC date of `t`, and before the newest bar any member has, is not passed. A member whose last bar is that newest bar is where the stored data ends, not a delisting, so it is neither left out nor named. A renamed ticker reads its ISIN's bars, so FB is not left out when Yahoo stores the history under META. The run is never silent about it: the execution stores one line per last-bar date in `Execution.notices`, and `fbull backtest run` folds them only when it prints, with a `⚠ ` prefix: one or two dates print one line each, three or more print one line with the total (`12 symbols had no prices before the run ended and were left out. Run with --verbose for the list.`), `fbull --verbose` adds every stored line under it, and a line names at most five symbols, then `and N more`. The stored lines stay complete for other readers, e.g. `3 symbols had no prices after 2026-03-31 and were left out: ABC, DEF, GHI.` or `1 symbol had no prices after 2026-03-31 and was left out: ABC.` A failed read of those last bars fails the run before Zipline starts. A symbol-list backtest (§7.3) is not filtered this way.

### 📝 7.3 Symbol-list backtests

A backtest created from a symbol list (`fbull backtest create --file`, for example `examples/demo.yaml`) has no `universe_member` rows. Its universe is the enabled `backtest_period_asset` rows of the period whose `[start_date, end_date]` holds the UTC date of `t`, sorted, each symbol once. That is the set `DownloadFinancialData` and `SQLIngester` put in the bundle. A disabled asset has no bars, so it is not passed.

The session decides once, before the first bar: any `universe_member` row for the backtest means §7.2, and an empty universe at `t` stays `[]`. No rows means this section. A failed read of the backtest or its membership fails the run before Zipline starts.

`RunBacktestRequest.benchmark` is the stored `backtest.benchmark` for both kinds. An empty benchmark makes Zipline use a flat zero series, so `benchmark_period_return` would be stored as `0`.

### 7.4 Bars of a renamed ticker

Bars stay on the ticker the provider stores them under, and the reader picks them by date through `asset_symbol`. Yahoo has no bars under FB for any date and serves the whole history, before the rename too, under META. Other providers may list FB up to the rename and META from it.

- **Download.** When the asked ticker returns no bars, the download looks up the instrument's other tickers in `asset_symbol` and the provider's current ticker for that instrument, fetches under those, stores bars under the ticker that answered, and records it in `asset_symbol` when it was missing. A member with no bars under any of its tickers, or any other per-symbol download `STATUS_ERROR` (GetAsset, store, …), fails `fbull backtest create` (the backtest is removed); it is not left out silently.
- **Zipline bundle.** `SQLIngester` builds one sid per ISIN alias by alias. Inside an alias's `asset_symbol` dates its own bars win, and a session without one takes the bar another ticker of the ISIN has. The first alias reaches back to the backtest start and the last one forward to its end.
- **User code.** `Asset.stock_data`, `Assets` and the close `Portfolio.order_value` uses resolve the ticker to the ISIN that holds it on the read date. On each bar time the ticker whose dates cover it wins, then the asked ticker, then another ticker of the ISIN. The frame keeps the asked ticker. A ticker with no `asset_symbol` row reads only its own bars.
- **Positions.** A held position is named by the ticker that started last on or before the session, so it reads FB before the rename and META from it, as the universe does. Zipline itself names an asset by its latest ticker.
- **Orders.** An order placed by ticker resolves to the ISIN that holds that ticker on the session the order is placed in, not on the backtest's last session. A ticker later reused by another ISIN still fills on the earlier asset.

### 7.5 Missing prices

A provider can have no price for a session a stock traded. Yahoo sends `null` in its price arrays for such a session.

- **Download.** A bar with any of open, high, low, or close missing, zero, negative, or non-finite is left out; it is never stored as `0`. `ohlc` refuses a non-positive or non-finite open, high, low, or close (`supplier.ErrRejected`), so a provider adapter that misses one fails the symbol's download instead of storing a `-100%` day.
- **Zipline bundle.** `SQLIngester` fills each session between a sid's first and last bar that has no bar, so Zipline's daily bar writer does not refuse the sid. A filled session takes the previous close as open, high, low, and close, and volume `0`: a held position keeps its value, and an order placed on that session does not fill under volume slippage. A stored row with a non-positive price (written before `ohlc` refused them) is treated as missing. Nothing before a sid's first bar is filled.
- **User.** The ingest returns one line per ticker in `IngestResponse.notices`; the `INGESTING` step completes with those lines as its message, and `fbull backtest create` prints them: `Missing prices for XYZ on 2026-05-02, filled with the previous close. No trades on those days.` or `Missing prices for XYZ on 4 days (2026-05-02 to 2026-05-07), filled with the previous close. No trades on those days.` Three or more tickers print one line, `Missing prices for 12 symbols, filled with the previous close. No trades on those days. Run with --verbose for the list.`, and `--verbose` lists each ticker.

## 8. Zipline `auto_close_date`

`SQLIngester.create_metadata` already declares `("auto_close_date", "datetime64[ns]")`. The writer builds `autoclose_date = end_date + pd.Timedelta(days=1)` then sets it to `None`.

Contract:

- One Zipline sid per ISIN. Each ticker of the ISIN is a symbol mapping of that sid (FB then META).
- A ticker's `start_date` / `end_date` = first and last bar the sid has inside that ticker's `asset_symbol` dates (§7.4), not the bars stored under the ticker.
- `auto_close_date` follows the broker's rule in §7.2. When the sid's last bar (`end_date`) is before the newest bar of any member (the benchmark does not count), it is the day after that bar, or the membership drop when that is earlier. Otherwise the stored data ends there, not the asset: it is the drop, or with no drop the day after the bundle's last day, so a benchmark session that no member has does not sell a held member. Do not overwrite with `None`. A member delisted mid-month has its last bar before the month-end drop, so Zipline closes a held position on the first session after that bar, the session the broker leaves the member out of `Process`, at the last close, and credits the cash. The portfolio value does not jump, and the position does not sit at a stale price until the drop.
- Write the column as `auto_close_date` to match the metadata dtype, not `autoclose_date`.
- A drop closes membership in `universe_member` and, once bars end, auto-closes the Zipline equity. A rename does not auto-close the sid: a held position carries over and changes name on the rename date; the ISIN remains a member.

## 9. `CreateBacktestFromETF` after this contract

1. Resolve `[start_date, end_date]` to sampled as-of dates (§5.2).
2. Read S0, the last list published on or before `start_date`, from the month-ends (and cached as-of dates) in the three months before it, newest first (§6.2).
3. Fill `etf_holdings_snapshot` from cache or iShares. A gap is filled from the latest list on or before it, S0 included.
4. Move S0 to `start_date` and drop as-of dates before it. Only when step 2 found nothing does the first list after the start seed it, with a warning naming the ETF, the start, and the as-of used.
5. Diff → `asset_symbol` + `universe_member` (§6). The first interval opens at the backtest start.
6. `backtest.benchmark` from `GetBenchmark`.
7. Ingest union (§7.1). Session PIT is a runtime read, not a stored yearly list.

`enabled = GetAsset(symbol)` is not part of membership. Looking up a ticker in Yahoo/Alpaca remains an ingest concern.

## 10. Non-goals

Do not implement in the universe work:

- Changing bar-provider defaults beyond what `Backtest.provider` already supports (`yahoo` default when omitted, `stooq`, `alpaca`). Leave Yahoo metadata and Alpaca wiring as they are in `pkg/finance/module.go`. `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER` is not read.
- Daily holdings dumps. Sample month-end or known rebalance as-of dates only.
- Paid index files, vendor constituent feeds, or licensing iShares beyond the existing public ajax JSON.
- Walk-forward, strategy domain, paper/live trading.
- Rewriting `ohlc` off `symbol`. A mapping layer + `asset_symbol` is enough.
- Changing `asset.symbol text primary key` or `UNIQUE (symbol, time)` on `ohlc`.
- Hitting live iShares in unit tests.
- Mocking Postgres with SQLite. Repository tests keep existing testcontainers helpers.

## 11. Current types (do not invent new ones)

Reuse these as-is where the new tables touch them:

| Column | Type | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backtest.name` | `text PRIMARY KEY` | `BacktestTable` |
| `backtest.benchmark` | `text NOT NULL` | `BacktestTable` |
| `backtest_period.start_date` / `end_date` | `date NOT NULL` | `BacktestTable` |
| `backtest_period_asset.symbol` | `text NOT NULL` | `BacktestTable` |
| `backtest_period_asset.enabled` | `boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` | `BacktestTable` |
| `asset.symbol` | `text primary key` | `AssetTable` |
| `asset.name` | `text` | `AssetTable` |
| `instrument.id` | `text PRIMARY KEY` (equals `isin`) | `InstrumentTable` |
| `instrument.isin` | `text UNIQUE` | `InstrumentTable` |
| `instrument.name` | `text` | `InstrumentTable` |
| `asset_symbol.isin` | `text NOT NULL` | `AssetSymbolTable` |
| `asset_symbol.symbol` | `text NOT NULL` | `AssetSymbolTable` |
| `asset_symbol.from_date` / `to_date` | `date` (`to_date` nullable) | `AssetSymbolTable` |
| `universe_member.backtest_name` | `text` FK `backtest(name)` | `UniverseMemberTable` |
| `universe_member.isin` | `text NOT NULL` | `UniverseMemberTable` |
| `universe_member.from_date` / `to_date` | `date` (`to_date` nullable) | `UniverseMemberTable` |
| `ohlc.symbol` | `TEXT references asset(symbol)` | `OHLCTable` |
| `ohlc.time` | `timestamp` | `OHLCTable` |
| `ohlc` uniqueness | `UNIQUE (symbol, time)` | `OHLCTable` |
| `trading_calendar_date.code` | `TEXT NOT NULL` | `CalendarTable` |
| `trading_calendar_date.date` | `date NOT NULL` | `CalendarTable` |
| ISIN | `string` / `text` | proto `Asset.ISIN`; iShares `row[8]` |

## 12. Status

Landed. ETF create samples month-end iShares as-of dates (filesystem JSON cache; Equity rows with ISIN). Identity is ISIN (`instrument` + `asset_symbol`); ticker is a dated alias (FB then META is one asset). Membership is half-open `universe_member` intervals from consecutive as-of diffs, seeded at the backtest start from the last list published on or before it: adds/drops change membership, ticker changes do not. Ingest unions every alias plus the benchmark; the session maps members through `asset_symbol` at `t` into `Process` (empty universe stays `[]`). A symbol-list backtest has no membership rows and passes its enabled period assets instead (§7.3). SQLIngester writes `auto_close_date` on a drop and keeps one sid across a rename. `GetAsset` failure is not a membership drop. Yearly `backtest_period` / `backtest_period_asset` rows remain for ingest windows; they are not membership.

Not in this work: reintroducing `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER`; daily holdings dumps; the `etf_holdings_snapshot` table (raw JSON cache is enough); hysteresis; rewriting `ohlc` off `symbol`.
